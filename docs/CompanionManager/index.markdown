## 💬 Notes

- Companion data is pulled from the "ZzCompanions" and "ZzzzToys" spell tabs. If your server uses different names, they may need to be adjusted in `CompanionManager.lua`.
- This addon is 100% compatible with WoW Classic (Vanilla 1.12.0, Interface 11200). It does **not** use any TBC or retail-only API features.
- Not all companions have been categorized. If you have a companion that isn't correctly categorized, please create an issue on Github and provide companion name and category it belongs to.
