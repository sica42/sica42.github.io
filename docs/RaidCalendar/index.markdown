## 📖 Usage

The first time you run RaidCalendar you will get a welcome popup where you are required to link up your discord account. Enter your Discord username or server nick and click "Verify". You will then get a DM on Discord where you have to confirm that your character should be allowed to use your Discord ID to sign up to events.

You can access the calendar by typing `/rc` or clicking the map icon. The map icon also has a tooltip showing upcoming raids

The overview window shows all upcoming raids.
* If you're signed up for an event, the signup icon will turn greeen.
* If you've soft reserved the maximum number of items, the SR icon will turn green.
* You can access settings from the "S" button in the top right corner.
  * You can choose to use your character name when signing up for events instead of your Discord name.
  * You can switch between 12/24-hour time format.
* You can shift-click an event or the SR icon to link the event/sr in chat (link will only work for people who have the addon installed)

If the raid has a SR sheet attached, you can click the SR icon to open the SR window.
* The SR dropdown supports search if you click anything but the down arrow. You can use tab/shift-tab to select items with the keyboard.
* Currently only a maximum number of 2 SR items are supported.
* If you have RollFor installed, you can click the E in the top right corner to export the data to RollFor. 

> [!NOTE]
> When you soft reserve using RaidCalendar this is done with a Discord account setup by the bot owner. Any changes will have to be done with RaidCalendar as they will not be avaible for you to edit on https://raid-helper.dev/.
> It's possible to registere soft reservers both with RaidCalendar and on the webpage. You will then have double SRs, so don't do that!
