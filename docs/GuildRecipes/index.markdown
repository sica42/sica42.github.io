With your chat open, you can shift-click items in the list to say the item. You can also shift-click the item icon to say the recipe with required reagents.
Message will be posted to your current chat channel, so ensure you have the right channel set before clicking.

You can assign a hotkey in Key Bindings to toggle the window.
