# TurtleCalendar
**Version:** 0.4
**Game Version:** Turtle WoW (Interface 11200)

Shows you an in-game calendar with all relevant timers:
* Raid lockouts
* Battleground of the day
* Darkmoon Faire location
* Instances lockout timers

Use `/turtlecalendar` or `/tc` to toggle calendar, or assign a hotkey in key bindings.

Right click the calendar to adjust the following options:
* Toggle visibility of the different timers.
* Toggle condensed timers
* Toggle date

If you are grouped and group leader does a "Reset all instances" you will have to manually reset the current instance timer. You can do this with `/tc reset`.
If the group leader have TurtleCalendar installed you do not need to do this.

> [!NOTE]
> Reset timers have only been added for european server.
> Nordanaar is 100% correct. Tel`Abim should be correct except Edge of Madness which currently is the same as Nordanaar.
> Reset timers for Ambershire are currently the same as Nordanaar and probably wrong.
> Please post a new issue under Issues if you play on another server and know the reset times.
